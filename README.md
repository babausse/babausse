Hi there, I'm a french developer, mainly working on web applications, and more recently on everything dealing with infrastructure, scalability and reliability.

I develop an application to manage your roleplaying campaigns on a neat web interface, powered by a scalable and reliable micro-services architecture on Kubernetes, find it [here](https://github.com/virtuatable)
